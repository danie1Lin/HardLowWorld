# Use the hard way to write hello world
Using VirtualBox to boot a OS which only prints Hello World.
Actually, it is not OS, but this project shows you how to boot os with grub2 in VirtualBox. LOL

## How to hello world the hard way

1. Run `vagrant up`
2. Double click the machine you just created in VirtualBox UI.

![like this](doc/double_click_virtualbox.png "like this")

Then you will see nothing but `hello world`. How exciting! ðŸ¤£

## Under the hood

After vagrant up, you will see the ubuntu provisioning with `boot.sh`.
These are what `boot.sh` does.
1. Compile the HelloOS program which print "Hello World" but has no dependencies like `stdio.h`.
2. Modify the grub config in `/etc/default/grub`, switch the default booting OS to HelloOS.
3. Set how HelloOS boot in `/boot/grub/grub.cfg`.

## Dependent tools
- Vagrant
- VirtualBox
